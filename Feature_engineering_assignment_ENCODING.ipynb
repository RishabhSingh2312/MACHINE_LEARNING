One-hot encoding or dummy encoding can be used to represent this variable as a set of binary flags, where each category is represented by a binary column. One-hot encoding can be preferred over other encoding methods as it allows the model to capture the individual effects of each category on the target variable.\n",

    "#### The \"Employment Status\" variable has three unique categories (Unemployed/Part-Time/Full-Time). Ordinal encoding or target-guided ordinal encoding can be used for this variable. Ordinal encoding assigns a unique ordinal value to each category based on their rank or order. Target-guided ordinal encoding assigns an ordinal value to each category based on their relationship with the target variable. The choice of encoding method will depend on the nature of the relationship between the categorical variable and the target variable. If there is a clear ordering or hierarchy among the categories, ordinal encoding can be used. On the other hand, if the target variable has a strong correlation with the categories, target-guided ordinal encoding can be preferred as it captures the relationship between the categorical variable and the target variable."
