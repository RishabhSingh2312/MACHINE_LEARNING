    "### Overfitting occurs when the model is too complex and has learned the noise and specifics of the training data rather than the general pattern or trend. As a result, the model may perform very well on the training data but poorly on the test data because it has not learned the underlying relationship between the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### On the other hand, underfitting occurs when the model is too simple and unable to capture the underlying pattern of the data. As a result, the model may perform poorly on both the training and test data because it has not learned the complexity of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The consequences of overfitting are that the model will have a high variance and will not generalize well to new data, making it useless for real-world applications. The consequences of underfitting are that the model will have a high bias and will not accurately capture the relationship between the variables, leading to poor predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### To mitigate overfitting, techniques such as regularization, cross-validation, and early stopping can be used. Regularization involves adding a penalty term to the loss function to discourage the model from learning too much from the noise in the training data. Cross-validation involves splitting the data into multiple training and test sets to assess the model's performance on different data. Early stopping involves stopping the training process when the model's performance on the validation set stops improving."

    "### Increasing the amount of training data: One of the most effective ways to reduce overfitting is to increase the amount of training data. This allows the model to learn more general patterns in the data and reduces the chances of it memorizing specific examples.\n",
