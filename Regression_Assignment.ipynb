    "### Simple linear regression involves modeling the relationship between two variables: a dependent variable (Y) and a single independent variable (X). The aim of simple linear regression is to fit a straight line to the data that best explains the relationship between the variables. For example, if we want to study the relationship between the number of hours studied and the exam score of a student, we can use simple linear regression where the number of hours studied is the independent variable and the exam score is the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple linear regression, on the other hand, involves modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (Y) and two or more independent variables (X1, X2, X3, etc.). The aim of multiple linear regression is to fit a linear equation to the data that best explains the relationship between the variables. For example, if we want to study the relationship between the price of a house and its characteristics such as the number of bedrooms, the square footage, and the age of the house, we can use multiple linear regression where the price of the house is the dependent variable, and the number of bedrooms, square footage, and age of the house are the independent variables."

    "### Multicollinearity is a phenomenon that occurs in multiple linear regression when two or more independent variables in the model are highly correlated with each other. This can cause problems in the model such as making it difficult to determine the individual effect of each independent variable on the dependent variable, leading to unreliable and unstable estimates of the model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### One common way to detect multicollinearity is to calculate the correlation matrix of the independent variables and look for high correlations between them. A commonly used threshold is a correlation coefficient of 0.7 or higher. Another method is to calculate the variance inflation factor (VIF) for each independent variable. VIF measures how much the variance of the estimated coefficient is inflated due to multicollinearity. A VIF value greater than 5 or 10 is considered a cause for concern.\n",

    "### There are several ways to address multicollinearity in multiple linear regression. One approach is to remove one or more of the highly correlated independent variables from the model. This can be done by either using domain knowledge or using variable selection methods such as stepwise regression, LASSO, or ridge regression."
